            <h1>Vite Gutenberg Plugin - Experimental Plugin</h1>
            <p>
                This plugin is under construction things may not work as
                expected. Currently this plugin builds block correctly but it
                does not do the same when served from dev server, until I figure
                this out this plugin is sort of useless so experiment at your
                own risk.
